It's morbidly funny when people pretend that they don't understand this rather obvious difference.

Burn a bible, nothing happens. Burn the Qur'an, welp.

But pretending to not understand the obvious is a great way to avoid debate, so people who can't win the argument love it.

There's even more evidence that GLP-1RAs work worse for diabetics.

A related concept is that effects can certainly be real without knowing mechanisms.

For example, we know that acetaminophen (Tylenol) definitely works for managing fever and pain.

Despite being used for more than a century, we still don't know the mechanism behind it.

Mechanistic evidence requires statistical evidence to get us to working drugs, but statistical evidence does not require mechanistic evidence.

If you have a weak body part you want to bring up in strength and/or size you need to change your programming for a short while. This explains how. It’s not simply a matter of doing more work. You have to offset that elsewhere.

I’m surprised. 
According to ⁦@bretcontreras⁩ the tempo of lifting and lowering a weight does NOT impact hypertrophy much— BUT you do need to control the concentric (lifting) & eccentric (lowering) phase of each rep & not use momentum to avoid injury & get results.

There is nothing inherently wrong with a Y axis set to the range of the data.

Displaying a Y axis from zero is optimal for plenty of datasets. Most of my charts on here do so.

And midwits have been trained on that common case, so they deploy the critique without understanding the data.

The HHS claims to have explained the autism epidemic.

Their answer? Folic acid and Tylenol.

Their answer is wrong, their evidence is bad, and they're avoiding actually ending the autism epidemic.

Top 4 metabolic health and body composition levers, in no particular order:

Here’s why:

Physical activity means moving your body, but at a lower intensity than what would qualify as exercise. Obvious example: walking. 

Don’t be sitting all the time!

Set a step target if useful (personally, I don’t have one, and most of my clients don’t have one either).

Resistance training is by far the most predictable way to:

1) Protect against muscle and bone loss that would otherwise happen as one ages 

2) Build new muscle 

New other form of training, no sport or physical activity is anywhere near as effective.

To be clear, the type of weight loss required is fat loss, because excess body fat negatively impacts metabolic health. 

Case in point: millions of people with normal BMI are prediabetic, diabetic or on their way due to poor metabolic health (insulin resistance).
