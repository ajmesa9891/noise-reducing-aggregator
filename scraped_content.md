Do the math.

An Uber driver in Austin, TX, can expect to make an average of $58,720 per year, or about $28 per hour.

A Model 3 costs Tesla an estimated $28k.

A Model 3, fully produced and running for however long a model 3 will run, costs less than paying a driver for 6 mos.

I said this would be short, so I'll stop rambling and just say this:

Phenotyping really matters.

It matters for questions of scientific interest (e.g., 'what's up with the missing heritability?') and, more importantly, it matters for clinical and product development reasons.

[Source](https://x.com/cremieuxrecueil/status/1938392442765750711)

And if you just got here without knowing what "missing heritability" refers to, go check out this article:

---

Even more immediately practically, bad phenotyping means that medical use-cases are going to be limited.

Heel ultrasounds provide a quantitative measure of the risk of osteoporotic fractures. But, in their stead, we often just have FRAX questionnaire risk factors.

[Source](https://x.com/cremieuxrecueil/status/1938392357495574774)

---

Readily-available FRAX risk factors add minimally to age, sex, and BMI in terms of the explained variance in fracture risk.

A genetic speed-of-sound polygenic score (gSOS), however, explains a huge amount, adding greatly to rapid screening ability, for those with genetic data.

[Source](https://x.com/cremieuxrecueil/status/1938392396691079345)

---

By having these better phenotypes available, we can get clinically usable polygenic scores right away.

The U.K. wants to have everyone's genomes so they can use these sorts of polygenic scores. When those are available, having these scores could save billions on screenings.

---

A reliability of 0.55 is atrocious.

Side note: The reliability is not that correlation of 0.83. Common source of confusion, but that is a mediocre correlation, especially given overlapping items.

Removing those cuts it down to 0.74. For a good measure, r should be ~1.

[Source](https://x.com/cremieuxrecueil/status/1938392294883004767)

---

This matters a lot for missing heritability, but it matters even more for practical matters.

Bad measures create biased measurements of unclear worth, and the results of using them might generalize poorly, creating delusory out-of-sample issues.

[Source](https://x.com/cremieuxrecueil/status/1938392311328555316)

---

For example, if I run a GWAS on a spatial (for which there's a good amount of non-g variance) test-heavy battery, I might accidentally make a score that, when used for embryo selection, makes for high-spatial babies without dragging along as much for g, the desired target.

mJSW is correlated with what we'd hope it would be if it really were picking up on osteoarthritis risk.

For example, it does a decent job discriminating cases from controls by both the ICD-10 and the deep learning definitions, and the width declines with age.

[Source](https://x.com/cremieuxrecueil/status/1938392023457030318)

---

This is important.

Even just measuring any phenotype's heritability across methods on a consistent sample cuts major chunks out of the missing heritability.

This is much better practice than comparing twin and SNP heritabilities from completely different samples.

[Source](https://x.com/cremieuxrecueil/status/1938392239161446672)

---

But this is rarely mentioned.

Why? As I said, this is the "vast, minimally-explored frontier in [GWASs]".

There are some papers dealing with phenotyping, but not nearly enough.

This is huge for many phenotypes like IQ, where the available biobank measurements suck.

[Source](https://x.com/cremieuxrecueil/status/1938392269381423507)

---

So let's talk about osteoarthritis again.

It turns out a binary phenotype for osteoarthritis kind of sucks. You either have the condition or don't, right? Not really. There's quantitative variation in how much bone touching there is.

We can account for that with deep learning.

[Source](https://x.com/cremieuxrecueil/status/1938392017673064601)

---

In this instance, you take those images from before, and you calculate the minimum joint space width (mJSW), the minimum inter-bone joint space between the femur and the tibia.

The smaller the space, the greater the osteoarthritis level, quantitatively.

Basically.

Education became less cognitively elite primarily because it became mass-market:

Education stopped requiring lots of family resources to attend. People started getting loans, environments mattered less, and heritability rose in more recent cohorts!

[Source](https://x.com/cremieuxrecueil/status/1938392013180965350)

---

If you run a GWAS on education measured across very differently aged birth cohorts, you're liable to get some weird results because the meaning of the phenotype has changed over time and there's no simple way to adjust for this.

In fact, adjusting is frequently biasing!

[Source](https://x.com/cremieuxrecueil/status/1938392015416213923)

---

Anyway, moving on.

The other thing about phenotyping is not just missingness which, as I've noted, can be selective. But also, quality.

Sometimes the measurements you have available just suck.

Take education. Having a degree used to be cognitively elite. Now, it's not.

[Source](https://x.com/cremieuxrecueil/status/1938392009326440509)

---

Everyone with this condition isn't necessarily diagnosed with it.

This is especially true for men, who tend to just ignore this (and many other conditions) more often than women do.

This is, in a word, annoying, because it means that if you study it, sampling is likely biased.

[Source](https://x.com/cremieuxrecueil/status/1938391988854001854)

---

If you diagnose in this way, you could reduce the number of GWAS hits through reducing bias, or increase the number through statistical power.

In the limit, bias likely isn't enough to overwhelm the effects of increasing statistical power a lot for >=moderately heritable traits.

[Source](https://x.com/cremieuxrecueil/status/1938392004083225001)

---

In this case, the effect might've been similar to what happens when you leverage oddball things like:

- A GWAS of sex across the autosomes
- A GWAS of filling out optional biobank intake forms
- A GWAS accounting for measurement error
- A GWAS of wearable vs self-report exercise

To put that differently, if you want to extend period lifespans by an additional year, the required percentage reduction in all-cause mortality to do so has grown about 2.5 times since 1900.

Another GLP-1 idea, this time dual GLP-1/glucagon agonism, seems to have failed.

This drug was supposed to help the liver a bunch thanks to glucagon. But it helped substantially less than tirzepatide, which lacks glucagon.

This looks basically like semaglutide.

The press release is all hype, no substance.

They talk about discontinuation rates being great, and they turn out to actually be middling.

They talk about weight loss, and it's not that much.

They talk about MASH benefits, and they're less than for existing, approved drugs.

[Source](https://x.com/cremieuxrecueil/status/1938268780762702260)

---

This moves me somewhat towards the position that retatrutide's extra benefits are due to greater GIP agonism rather than the added glucagon.

I helped @slatestarcodex with this post. At least with respect to some traits (e.g. education, bmi), we are in an epistemic crisis about their heritability. We have multiple strong methods - twin studies, RDR, sibling, GREML-WGS - that are not converging on a consensus reality.

"As much as" is doing a lot of work. The amount lost with these drugs is not any more alarming than with non-GLP-1RA weight loss.

The trial in question showed losses with semaglutide were consistent with the well-known rule that a quarter of weight loss is lean.

ADHD is a condition that's suffered from diagnostic drift: it's been defined more leniently over time, so more people are getting diagnosed.

One way to see this is to look at the benefits of taking ADHD medication. As prescription rates increased, the benefits have declined.

[Source](https://x.com/cremieuxrecueil/status/1937970657913938225)

---

An even more direct way to understand ADHD's diagnostic drift is to look at what types of diagnoses happen over time.

The increase has been more about non-severe ADHD than clinical ADHD. In other words, people with less and lesser symptoms are getting diagnosed.

[Source](https://x.com/cremieuxrecueil/status/1937970664142503940)

---

And of course, plenty of people just want to get diagnosed to get the drugs. Go out and ask people, and you can quickly find examples.

One potential explanation of the finding that GLP-1RAs help to ward off dementia is that the comparison group is people taking insulins, which lead to dementia.

But this is only partially true. Insulins are bad, but semaglutide seems to beat many different therapies.

[Source](https://x.com/cremieuxrecueil/status/1937955607979434409)

---

But, caveat:

These are only causal results under restrictive assumptions. We have some trial results that suggest GLP-1RAs help with dementia, but they haven't brought us enough certainty to compare treatments, and there's concern that specific treatment matters for the outcome.

President Trump has done the impossible:
— eliminated Iran’s nuclear threat;
— negotiated Israel-Iran ceasefire;
— rejected regime change as a policy objective;
— demanded that Israel comply with the ceasefire.

No one could do more. Now it’s time to focus on domestic priorities.

At a pivotal time for AI, we shouldn't have a patchwork of state AI laws - many of them taken from the EU or sketchy Biden-funded NGOs.

Regime change was always a fantasy. You can’t collapse a regime with air power alone; it takes boots on the ground and occupation, which was never going to happen. Neocons have been exposed as delusional warmongers yet again.
