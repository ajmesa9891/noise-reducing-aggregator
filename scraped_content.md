Pancreatitis is a commonly mention potential side effect of GLP-1RAs, but the evidence for it is poor.

I’m hosting a guest on Huberman lab podcast who is the world expert on sex differences in the brain- how differences not only in hormones, but in gene expression make males and females think and feel and act very differently to the same thing. What would you like me to ask them?

[Source](https://x.com/hubermanlab/status/1948039641007091799)

This researcher has also parsed the specific neural circuits and hormone influences on pretty much every aspect of sex behavior from the male and female side. Feel free to ask questions about that as well.

Technology will eventually have to drive human evolution (embryo selection, gene editing).

The two words that matter most for those who want to improve their health, mood, energy levels and quality of life:

Body composition. 

Let’s define it:

Peak human health (getting lean and fit) is easier to achieve (and takes a lot less time) than many people think. 

But it’s also a lot more complex than the “just do this one thing” (or “just avoid this one thing”) people claim.

Body composition refers to the components that make up your total weight. 

There are a few ways to think about the components, the best one in my view being the three-compartment model which includes:

Bone
Fat
Fat-free mass

Fat free mass includes both muscle and organs. 

When we talk about getting to and maintaining a low body fat %, it’s generally calculated as:

Fat mass divided by total weight (all three components).

It just so happens that one’s body composition, the relative degree to which one is lean and muscular, is highly linked to overall health.
