CREDENTIALS DON’T MATTER

Over the last few months, I’ve seen several A+ execs and operators flounder and fail at AI startups, while young “inexperienced” builders have crushed execution and performed superbly.

It’s the biggest discontinuity in talent evaluation I’ve seen in my

You've been lied to about what is happening in Gaza. Here's the truth:

-Hamas started this war, butchering about 1,200 Israelis and taking hundreds hostage (They still hold 50 in tunnels and cages).
-Israel sent 1.5 BILLION meals into Gaza, enough for 2 million people for more

Frustrated persistence is an effect of being interested, not a cause.

Interest causes persistence, and this discovers/creates the hardness*.

Interest is the prime mover.

The question is, did the interest arise creatively, or is it chosen because alternatives are blocked?

JAMA study finds that screentime has no influence on suicide, but this is buried in the discussion.

The main takeaway - the alarmist idea that addictive use patterns cause suicide.

(Of course, causality might go the other way - depression might cause addictive screen use.)

For completeness, the study:

1- Has no control group, so only tells us correlation.
2- Relies on self reporting, from 10 year olds! Adults can't accurately report what they ate yesterday.
3- Cannot distinguish addiction from being really interested in something.

In theory, a key benefit of committing to *not* bail out big banks, is that creditors will actually penalize them when they raise their default risk.

But as late 90s South Korea shows, just having a gov’t commit to something doesn’t matter, bc the commitment is not believable.

This is just lying.

Rules were not re-written to "benefit white Americans", they were changed so that they were no longer in violation of the law.

That is, they were changed so that people can no longer racially discriminate against anyone.

There's a belief low-carb or low-fat diets lead to more energy expenditure at the same levels of caloric intake.

Therefore, these diets—depending on what you favor—supposedly have better 'calories out' performance.

Today, major pharmaceutical manufacturers received a pointed letter from the Trump administration.

That letter explained that they will soon be provided with a new way to sell drugs:

Direct to patients, without middlemen, at low prices, absent the influence of PBMs.

[Source](https://x.com/cremieuxrecueil/status/1951021005167796320)

---

This is based.

PBMs add a lot of cost to drugs. Health insurers also add costs to drugs, in part because they're incentivized to by stipulations in the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare).

Getting both of those groups out of the way will help lower drug prices.

Did you know that malaria was a problem in Europe in living memory?

Europe wasn't declared free of endemic malaria cases until 1975! There were people getting malaria in parts of northern Germany in the 1960s!

But despite lacking modern biotech, Europe eliminated malaria.

People who grew up with more growth tend to be somewhat less zero-sum in their thinking about the world.

90% of skin aging is from day-to-day sun exposure… not sunburn.

Visible skin aging is UV-driven, and damage is cumulative. High UV exposure damages collagen, elastin, and DNA.

This causes:

Like the word healthy, the word lean doesn’t have a clear definition. 

So if we use it to say normal BMI…

Then yes, you could be lean by that definition yet be in poor metabolic health, because many people in the normal BMI range are “skinny-fat” (over fat and under muscled.)

I think the best way to think about metabolic health is how close to, or how far away one is from diabetes and obesity (sometimes called diabesity in the literature). 

Now, no one can control everything about their health…

[Source](https://x.com/Mangan150/status/1950170391327936759)

---

But much of it, and I’d even argue MOST of it, for most adults, is in fact in their sphere of influence and often, within their full control. 

So I think it’s wise to let go of the idea that most health problems “just happen” or that it’s normal to age poorly. It’s not!

Large difference in relative risk of heart disease between physical activity and fitness.

At least three possible reasons:

3. Healthy people exercise

The single biggest cause of poor metabolic health is going from one unsustainable “current thing” to the next. 

You can lose and gain back the same 20-50 pounds forever unless you adopt a series of protocols specifically designed for your real life situation and constraints.

In my experience working with 1500+ people who are X users, many people don’t need a full-blown lifestyle change. Many are directionally doing ok or even fairly good, and need some relatively small tweaks to produce big, consistent, predictable and sustainable results.

If you want to avoid plaque and heart disease, LDL (or apoB) aren’t what I’d worry about. 

My focus would be on eliminating insulin resistance, and thus getting in excellent metabolic health. 

The best way to get in excellent metabolic health is to get lean, fit and strong.

Here’s what I consider to be the most important health markers. 

You’ll notice a cholesterol/lipid panel isn’t useless. But the important data points aren’t total and LDL cholesterol. It’s HDL cholesterol and triglycerides that I consider important.
