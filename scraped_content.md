One thing I'll note:

It does seem like the problem is more amenable to being fixed, or at least not being a nuisance, when the homeless are spread out more.

Big cities seemingly can't handle the sheer numbers that, say, N-many small towns can.

BigTech will spend $345B on cap ex for AI buildouts this year, a 2.5x in just 2yrs.

Not crazy compared to global telecom spend of $1.5T.

OpenAI Stargate’s $500B promise by 2029 would be ~25% of a projected ~$2T spend at a 58% sustained growth. Sam sees the exponential.

[Source](https://x.com/deedydas/status/1972354798281523695)

Technically it’s << 25% since $500B is over 4yrs so if we assume a ramp to $200B in 2029 then it’s ~10%. Then again if you slice specifically by AI hw spend, it could be closer to the 25%.

Alas, your phone or computer screen won’t accomplish this. At least not in the morning. Unfortunately, after sundown, your phone or computer screen is a pretty good tool to suppress melatonin and increase cortisol. That’s because your light sensitivity shifted.

Controversial (for other reasons) neuroscientist Robert Heath found long ago that given the option to self stimulate different brain areas to experience different feelings most people opt to stimulate areas that evoke feelings of mild frustration & anger. Arousal is reinforcing.

What’s remarkable is they preferred this feeling over sexual arousal, happiness, laughter, drunkenness. Arousal with mild frustration in anger is indeed a drug. It’s just that we make it ourselves. Watch your behavior. Chances are you’re hooked.

Maybe the hardest idea to transmit to someone who is sedentary, out of shape and overweight is just how much better it feels, minute by minute, to be lean, fit, strong and energetic. Kind of like how good one feels the day after getting over a bad cold.

Improving your lifestyle has no downside if it doesn’t come at the expense of your free time.

Now, someone who doesn’t exercise at all will need to reallocate some of their time towards health.

But much less than most people think…

Because a single hour per week is enough.

[Source](https://x.com/Mangan150/status/1974143200484077874)

---

For everything else that may need tweaking, it doesn’t have to take more time that it’s taking you now. 

In fact, there are likely ways to net save time, and so the hour per week needed for exercise can become “time neutral” for those who are hyper focussed on efficiency.

"The reduction of skeletal muscle glycogen after exercise allows a healthy storage of carbohydrates after meals and prevents development of type 2 diabetes."

Decreasing your glycogen stores is a key to increasing insulin sensitivity and decreasing chronic disease risk, and with aerobic exercise, it may take hours to deplete them.

High-intensity exercise can do that in minutes.

The first manifestation of insulin resistance, ultimately leading to type 2 diabetes, is in skeletal muscle.
