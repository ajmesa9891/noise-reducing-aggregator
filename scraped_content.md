any way to specify distance lower than a number when querying to avoid retrieving results and filtering in memory?

e.g. topK: 5, minScore: .85 (so at most 5 if all > .85)

is there a way to programmatically filter search results in autorag before the answer is generated? think dynamic authorization use case (eg doc sharing)

or should I just use vectorize and do it on top of it?

Short thread:

How does parental income related to kids' psychiatric disorders as they age?

First up: Schizophrenia and anxiety.

A parent in the lowest income quartile predicts considerably higher relative risk for both conditions, but there's more stratification in anxiety.

[Source](https://x.com/cremieuxrecueil/status/1963731980975059237)

---

Looking at the risk of any psychiatric disorder, it's substantial in the whole population.

Over 10% of people from poor families have a mental disorder, compared to <10% for the rest. Couple that with that the poor have worse disorders and it's alarming.

The richer the parents, the lower kids' risk of developing a psychiatric disorder. But why?

Does anyone understand the relationship between iPhone ChatGPT voice mode and the underlying models?

Is it still stuck with the old GPT-4o voice model, or is it using the new gpt-realtime model?

Here you have my site Remote OK

It loads in 27ms on a $99/mo Hetzner VPS with Cloudflare's Free plan

It's a basic caching rule

But Cloudflare by default caches all your static assets: images, CSS files, JS files

If you want pages cached too you can just add a cache rule

Make sure you add an exception for login cookies or you get the classic issue of logged in pages of users

## @tednaiman

TL;DR: Low protein (<~10%) → FGF21 up → more heat, more protein-seeking. It explains short-term EE rises—even on carb-, fat-, or alcohol-heavy diets (hello, “sugar diet”). Neat hack for the lean; unreliable for obesity; poor long-term strategy.

Q:  Why can a ≤ 9% protein diet raise calorie burn?

A: FGF21. 

When essential amino acids are scarce, your liver flips a nutrient-stress program and secretes FGF21—the “low-protein signal.”

This is what powers ‘the sugar diet’, or oil-based keto. Let’s talk about it.

…

[Source](https://x.com/tednaiman/status/1962749625439584262)

---

Alcohol angle: ethanol spikes FGF21 hard (your body’s “whoa, stop drinking” signal). It will add even more to the low protein energy expenditure bump, but trading protein for booze is a bad health trade and not a sustainable weight-loss plan. DO NOT TRY.



[Source](https://x.com/tednaiman/status/1962749682066895253)

---

Will this work for everyone? 

FGF21 resistance matters: many with obesity already have elevated FGF21 yet show blunted responses in target tissues. Cranking it further with low-protein tricks may do less than expected in those who most want fat loss. 

https://doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.14117.1…

[Source](https://x.com/tednaiman/status/1962749678765908484)

---

Also, humans aren’t mice. Protein restriction consistently raises FGF21 in people, but EE increases are modest/variable, and hunger for protein can climb — so adherence tanks or intake rebounds. Cool physiology ≠ durable fat loss strategy. You might want to play the long game.

[Source](https://x.com/tednaiman/status/1962749671895638284)

---

But as a long-term plan? Not great. Staying <~10% protein risks lean mass loss, stronger protein-seeking drive (you get hungrier for protein), and possible micronutrient shortfalls. The signal says “fix the shortage,” not “live here forever”.  

[Source](https://x.com/tednaiman/status/1962749665419644939)

---

Under the hood, FGF21 can also ramp futile cycles and lipid turnover, further “leaking” energy as heat. It’s your body choosing inefficiency on purpose while protein is scarce — buying time to find actual protein.  

https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molmet.2015.06.008…

[Source](https://x.com/tednaiman/status/1962749658561945846)

---

That’s why the trendy “sugar diet” can look like a metabolic party trick: low protein + lots of sugar = big FGF21 pulses → more heat “waste”, and sometimes weight loss despite more calories — because the furnace is running inefficiently.  

[Source](https://x.com/tednaiman/status/1962749651792326927)

---

How do all the extra carbs/fat/alcohol macros fit? They don’t fix the protein shortage, and some even keep FGF21 elevated (e.g., fructose via ChREBP; ethanol is a potent FGF21 trigger). So you can see higher EE whether the rest is carbs, fat, or alcohol.

[Source](https://x.com/tednaiman/status/1962749644099985684)

---

How does this happen? The mechanism goes like this:

low AAs → liver stress sensing → FGF21 → brain → sympathetic nerves → brown/beige fat thermogenesis.

Net: higher resting energy expenditure and a nudge to hunt protein — not stash extra calories.

https://doi.org/10.1172/JCI77508…

[Source](https://x.com/tednaiman/status/1962749638353789325)

---

Anthropomorphic take: your body thinks, “we’re short on building blocks.” 

Solution: conserve protein, burn off surplus fuels (carb/fat/ethanol) as heat, and push you to seek protein. That’s a smart survival play when prey/protein is hard to find.

Basal is usually 50% or more, so you have it backwards. But that doesn’t matter…what you are missing is that insulin secretion—BOTH BASAL AND POSTPRANDIAL—is proportional to overfatness.  It is just valiantly trying to clear fuels out of the circulation, irrespective of diet.

And while I’m not sold on the new injectable drugs, and wouldn’t personally take on the additional risks because I know how to achieve similar results with lifestyle alone, the one thing that’s clear is that they address the core problem for most people: appetite control.

---

Outside appetite control, the biggest problem with conventional weight loss is the idea that someone needs to give up a significant % of their free time to exercise. I’m not saying this can’t work, but it’s clearly not efficient, and it’s a non-starter for most working adults.

In general, I think we should aim to have fewer laws. 

But when it comes to pharma advertising, I think a total ban is in order, because the industry’s multi-billion ad spend buys them outsized influence on news organizations, and make it unlikely their wrongdoings get exposed.

One could also argue that advertisers prey on people who watch cable news (which for the record I find unwatchable), especially the elderly, potentially creating a worldview where they’ll look at drugs like the only solution to their problems, with no consideration for lifestyle.

Someone who wants to improve their health, and needs to lose weight, should focus on getting rid of excess body fat, first and foremost, before using their finite time and energy on other aspects of health, biohacking, and so on. Get a consistent fat loss pace going first!

In my view this also applies to most mental health issues. Losing the excess weight, if there is some (and there probably is), should be the very first step, because metabolic health and body composition are highly linked to mental health.

If you're in anything but the worst kind of shape, walking is not going to increase your VO2max.

VO2 max is up to 72% heritable, meaning that variation between two people in their VO2max can be up to 72% due to genetics.

That of course does not mean that your VO2max is not worth improving, or that you can't improve it; obviously you can.

25 bip rate cut is locked for September and another one before end of year
