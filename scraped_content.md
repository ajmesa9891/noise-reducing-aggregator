Cool demo of a GUI for LLMs! Obviously it has a bit silly feel of a “horseless carriage” in that it exactly replicates conventional UI in the new paradigm, but the high level idea is to generate a completely ephemeral UI on demand depending on the specific task at hand.

I should clarify that the risk is highest if you're running local LLM agents (e.g. Cursor, Claude Code, etc.).

If you're just talking to an LLM on a website (e.g. ChatGPT), the risk is much lower *unless* you start turning on Connectors. For example I just saw ChatGPT is adding
