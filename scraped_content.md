This is completely expected, and this is the first thing we talk about at Gauntlet AI.

When you first start using AI as an engineer your productivity will decrease. 

That is expected.

The difference with investing in VC-backed vs indie companies is the math

You invest 1000 times $100k

So you spend $100M in investment

998 don't exit, investment gone

2 exits for $1B, you own 10%

You now have $200M return on your $100M investment, aka 100% gain

One exits, they sell for 5x, probably $2M ARR, so $10M, you own 10%, so you get $1M back

But the other 9 don't exit

That's assuming a very positive success probability of 10%, reality is

- never eating out
- avoiding 95% of every grocery store, only buying produce
- pre-portioned meals
- 90 minutes of exercise daily
- walking after every meal
- 10k steps daily
- raw veggies to start each meal

-Triglycerides/HDL ratio under 2 
-A1C under 5.6% without meds
-Waist-to-height ratio under .5

Almost anyone can achieve all of these in 1 hour per week, as a byproduct of getting lean and fit.

Carbohydrate restriction regulates the adaptive response to fasting

"restriction of dietary carbohydrate, not the general absence of energy intake itself, is responsible for initiating the metabolic response to short-term fasting."

---

Insulin regulates fat breakdown (lipolysis), and small reductions of insulin within the normal range greatly increase lipolysis.

Fasting leads to lower insulin.

But, it also depends on what you're eating the rest of the time, and your insulin sensitivity (metabolic health).

[Source](https://x.com/Mangan150/status/1941824707533369419)

---

In other words, if you have good metabolic health - which is reflected in good body composition - and you don't eat the SAD (Standard American Diet), you might get lower insulin and increased fat burning in much less time than, say, 16 hours of fasting.

I think part of what’s going on is that a lot of people did try, and fail with a lifestyle approach. 

They don’t have a serious food addiction problem, but they haven’t been able to lose, or keep off the weight.

Physiological stress from exercise does not increase linearly with intensity, but exponentially.

Relatively small amounts of high intensity exercise get the job done.

When someone is lean, fit and relatively muscular, they’re at low risk for things like heart disease and many forms of cancer. 

They’re very unlikely to become pre-diabetic or worse, and they almost surely don’t have fatty liver.
