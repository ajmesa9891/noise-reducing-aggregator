It’s regular ppl in a room, tasked with creating knowledge, a judgment. No experts.

There is explicitly no authority. Everyone knows it’s up to them to figure it out.

The focus is doubt, falsification, not confirmation/justification.

The concern over the origin of beliefs is misleading, for it ignores what is done with beliefs once they have been acquired. — @Ray_S_Percival

The form and type of origination isn’t what makes something rational, it’s only what is done afterward (ie error correction) that matters.

There’s nothing inherently wrong with bias. Rational means correcting bias toward truth.

1- My experience IS a good starting point, since it concerns what is most important to me.
2- Treating myself as rational IS a good starting place, because it’s true (and also bc #1).

Several points:

3- This comment ignores the elephant in the room, which is that controlling someone, even if done for their own good, will always produce a host of harms, including loss of trust and degraded relationships.

This is a bit ironic because trusting relationships are an essential safeguard.

America is set for its lowest number of illegal border crossings since 2017.

But enforcement actions are ramping up after the OBBA, so I've attached a poll below for people to speculate about whether it'll actually be lower than 2017 by the end of the year.

You could argue this shows MLRs weren't harmful.

You could also argue that MLRs were needed to account for plans that had very low ratios prior to the ACA.

That's highly debatable and I don't think plan performance actually related to achieved MLRs back then, but regardless, really low MLRs were rare.

And funny enough, MLR rules were unnecessary for even their intended purpose. The rule is 80% for individual/small group, and 85% for large group markets.

Obese men who stayed at high altitude (2650 meters) for 2 weeks had higher basal metabolic rate, consumed fewer calories, and lost ~1.5 kg weight, seemingly mostly fat mass.

The study attributes this to hypobaric hypoxia, likely leading to altered hormones such as leptin.

High intensity exercise can partially replicate some of these effects, as it leads to localized (muscular) lack of oxygen.

There are 1001 little details that can improve health and reduce risk.

Obesity looks intractable for the population as a whole, but it isn't for the individual.

Medical experts are excited by GLP-1 drugs as anti-aging tools, e.g. in this study in which they mitigated Alzheimer's (in mice) by activating AMPK.
