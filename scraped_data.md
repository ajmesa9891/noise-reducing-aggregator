High-fructose corn syrup does not have any more deleterious health effects than normal sugar.

But it is cheaper due to subsidies it receives and the sugar tariff-rate quota.

Two interesting findings about milk:

1. There's ongoing selection for lactase persistence (i.e., lactose tolerance)

2. Selection in Europeans postdates becoming milk-drinkers. This fits with other groups that consume dairy products with high rates of lactose intolerance.

Americans are encouraged to consume three glasses of milk or milk equivalents per day.

But as of 2022, they're far off from this goal. In fact, dairy consumption has been going down for decades.

Firstly, the milk was unsafe in no small part because that is the natural state of milk.

Milk without quality standards for its harvest and pasteurization for after it's obtained is frequently unsafe. This is still true with "raw milk" today:

The issues with harvesting milk were generally much worse in the past than they are today.

Cows that had any issues were moved into the worst conditions, fed rotted grain, and typically only survived in this state for a few months, during which they often produced blue milk.

People believe being a founding engineer at a startup is a “scam” because of high variance: some strike gold, others get burnt.
