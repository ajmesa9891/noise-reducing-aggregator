Mainstream Linux distros have been focused for too long on being as similar to Windows and Mac as possible to ease adoption. I've come to believe this isn't the way. Linux needs to embrace its own aesthetic, its own ethos, unapologetically. Lean into rice and TUIs!

Problem with copying an existing commercial aesthetic or feel is that it reduces your appeal to the ideological (it's open source!) and price (it's better because it's free!). As marketing goes, that's a limited angle. We need to bring THE UNIQUE SIZZLE.
