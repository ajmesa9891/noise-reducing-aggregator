Yes! The importance of a topic is inversely proportional to the importance of forcing it.

It is *too important* to force.

And given the unknowability of the impacts of future knowledge, all topics are potentially important.

I’m a reformed root-causer.

Easy-to-vary explanations abound when seeking root causes (“It’s the SYS-tem!”), and it’s easy to self righteously shield pet theories from criticism.

My research is about how to build minds, and what makes human minds uniquely powerful.

That work, and lots of other cool work, is funded by @ConjectureInst, whose major backer up to now has been @naval.

If you can help us raise money & expand, let’s talk! DM me!

From our Glossary:

Arguments are themselves theory-laden, conjectural, and subject to error. 

Moreover, we can discover entirely new modes of criticism—deeper and more constraining criteria that our ideas must meet to be regarded as unproblematic.

From Conjecture Institute's Glossary:

When explanations are universal, it is rational to regard any apparent or suggested exceptions as regularities that can be explained via the universal theory in question, even if the detailed connection has not yet been discovered.

“That five minutes of YouTube was so instructive…any time I have a question, I’m immediately on YouTube or Grok. t’s extraordinary.

You absolutely want to give kids those tools as early as they’re open to them.”

"The government does not declare by fiat that a dozen eggs are to be exchanged for two dollars, and a gallon of milk for one dollar (when they try to do this, chaos ensues). Instead, people figure this out on the open market."

From our Glossary:

Much as a hammer is a technology that allows people to solve a wider set of problems than they could solve with their bare hands, an institution is a kind of memetic technology that similarly expands the set of problems that people can solve.

the worst kind of OKR imo is “reliability at 99.99% the next quarter” when you are not hitting it

if you have a multi year goal for it, sure. but if you start a 3 month period and you are doing work to improve reliability, you know… you won’t hit it

better to work on concrete

 we had this issue when some folks in leadership started pushing for OKRs

in b2b founders and early employees are experts. actually “shipping something” is very likely to yield good results. not everyone is google

 pick any random (not unreasonably small) set of requests and there is always something worth spelunking on for hours 

more so if you know the infra and product code
