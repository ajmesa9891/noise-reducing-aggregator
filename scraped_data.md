I sold a rental property in December using @Opendoor and it was the best experience selling a home I'd ever had. Took literally an hour of our time. A realtor wanted us to put in $100k and spend several months renovating. Opendoor offered the price the realtor thought we'd sell

True, but making a generic app you have much more competition than entering a niche

You can if you got $100M in VC funding to back you and buy lots of ads

If you're indie, you kinda have to go for the niches

In 1934, Germany passed a law making it a crime to tell jokes or laugh at its leaders.

One of many ways to think about optimizing metabolic health:

Distance from diabetes.
[open](https://x.com/Mangan150/status/1967985077054550274)

---

If you picture a straight line, at one end you’d have optimal metabolic health, followed by insulin resistance, followed by diabetes. Then you’d have type 2 diabetes in the middle. 

And on the other side, you’d have more advanced cases, all the way to those requiring insulin.

So those who are in very poor metabolic health, currently requiring insulin, want to move closer to “better” diabetes, and eventually, past the middle and ideally, going all the way to the other end to get to / return to great metabolic health.
