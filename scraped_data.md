You just need to Fund the Police: increase the number of cops!

But high alert days don't distribute police evenly throughout the District.

It's clear why crime is way down in D.C., and why it will continue to be down compared to recent years, so long as the surge is ongoing.

It's because criminals fear police. They act a little less hastily and fewer people die as a result.

That's the power of police presence.

Terror alerts are not the sort of thing normal day-to-day criminals think about

Crime is way down in D.C.

Though violent crime went up in total, and officers became less effective, was it worth it? There's a dollar—or pound sterling—value to criminal victimization, so we can do the calculations, and...

Not worth it.

Unfortunately, with police being more distant, that means more crime and less effective policing when they finally do manage to make their way over to calls.

Clearance rates fell by about 0.7%, and they fell most in locations police disappeared from the most.

But remember how they didn't fire any frontline officers? That means they redistributed them to the remaining stations.

We can use that fact to see a direct corollary to what's happening in D.C. right now. At the remaining stations, crime went down a lot.

Violent crime went up ~11% in areas where stations were shut down.

In some cases, the antipathy was reversed.

Individuals like Boston's mayor Curley hated native Anglo-Saxon Americans, but even then, the hatred was not to do with either group considering the other non-White.

How are we beating back opioid overdoses and deaths?

One method is by dispensing fewer people from hospitals with opioids in hand.

Between 2017 and 2024, for example, the number of new mothers discharged with opioids almost halved!

Unfortunately, for a sizable percentage of people, labor is a way to get more opioids.

I'm not saying they're getting pregnant and going into labor for that reason, but I am sayin that they're using the excuse of labor to easily continue an opioid habit.

That's sad.

You can also use these variants to project the effect of

Blue: lowering Lp(a) levels over a person's lifetime
Red: lowering Lp(a) levels immediately

Lp(a)—like LDL—causes cumulative damage over the lifetime. The higher your levels, for longer, the worse your health will be.

Lp(a) might seem like a hopeless risk factor because, after all, what can you do about it?

And the answer is "wait just a moment"

Because a handful of drugs for Lp(a) are in trials, and they seem to work amazingly. The once-every-six-month drugs here reduces Lp(a) by 98%!
