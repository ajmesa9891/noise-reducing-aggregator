Slop is real.

So is Puritanism - the belief that others are well served by having the preferences of their betters forced on them.

There is high and low quality, but quality is largely subjective, and it's demeaning to smear stuff that other people like as slop.

It’s becoming clear that the constraint of Gauntlet AI will always be the student side.

There is an unlimited number of companies in need of top AI engineers.

There are very few able to meet Gauntlet’s bar.

If you know someone outstanding please encourage them to apply.

Today was an absolutely INSANE day at Gauntlet AI.

3000 years ago, the ancient Greeks already knew that physical and mental health were two sides of the same coin.

2000 years ago, Roman poet Juvenal coined the phrase “a healthy mind in a healthy body.” 

But today, we continue to treat body and mind as two separate systems.

The Lydian Stone explains diglossia: holy & mundane tongues. Holy languages are for prayer & high literature; the mundane for use; and how one can corrupt a holy language by misusing it.
Vatican II ~ 1960 harmed the Catholic Church by making people pray in the vernacular.

Travis Kalanick (@travisk) had @Uber’s path to disrupt Taxi’s built out back in 2011.

I've had like ten companies use me in their ads without permission.... it's nuts! 

Flattering to be sure, but seriously, just ask permission first!

College grads are spending $100,000+ to have a higher unemployment rate than [ checks notes ] -- everyone, including non-college graduates.  

This is because of AI.

1. It is simpler to give your existing employees AI tools than to bother them with mentorship. 

2. It's simpler

Job displacement is the entire bull case for AI valuations.

The vast majority of AI revenues will be a reallocation of dollars from human capital to compute.

Humans will find other work that is uniquely suited for our skills, as we have done throughout history.

Good words. Pretending that job displacement isn't happening is lying to the people. Tell them the truth so they can prepare for what's coming.

AI is obviously transformative but it breaks the wage->spend->earn loop that powers growth. 

Short-run: recession risk. 

Long-run: abundance. We’ll always want more than we can produce. Jobs will come.

We cannot afford to slow down AI. But we do need new economics to keep up.

Why are top banks still prohibiting or restricting access to Bitcoin ETFs on their wealth management platforms? Is this the last vestige of “debanking”?

Every day, I wake up and it's something new to wake up to, a W from the Trump admin, then go off to work for a while, return, and it's more W's. Every day. This is the hardest working White House in U.S. history!

My friend Big Balls (@as400495) is a hero. I took this photo after Edward protected a young woman from an attempted carjacking by 8 thugs near Dupont Circle. Violence like this in the heart of DC is completely unacceptable.

The kid who got attacked was "Big Balls" of DOGE infamy. He tried to step in and stop the woman from being attacked and this was the result. He lived up to his name, Big Balls, for standing up to a pack of thugs. Absolute legend who acted with bravery and courage. Respect.

Sir Niall: “There’s never been a good long game for Ukraine. I stand by my view that we should have tried to end the war in 2022 when they had the upper hand, and I think future historians will say that the Biden administration blundered terribly when it did not push hard to end

Why the AI job loss narrative is overhyped: AI models still need to be prompted and verified, often iteratively, to drive business value. As @balajis says, AI is middle-to-middle, not end-to-end. Humans do the stuff at the ends (supervision); AI does the stuff in the middle.

The AI infrastructure build-out is so gigantic that in the past 6 months, it contributed more to the growth of the U.S. economy than /all of consumer spending/

.@DavidSacks: “People are realizing that Trump's willingness to raise tariffs on countries as a threat to renegotiate better trade deals is working … Add it all up. It's effectively $2 Trillion of stimulus into the US but without money printing … so it's non-inflationary.”
