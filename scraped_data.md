We are going to work very hard to make @Opendoor an ideal place for people who want to go into founder mode.

By identifying as antifascist, the shooter felt they were licensed to kill fascists.

But Kirk wasn’t fascist, and that’s the real sleight of hand - that smearing him and others as such is legit.

I don't think it's damaging to his legacy to reveal this. 99% of what Charlie and I texted about was just studies.

He was a genuinely curious guy who wanted to learn more things about the world. I've never met another pundit who cared to learn about estimators and trial design!

Charlie Kirk was a moderate center-right conservative. People on the extreme right hated him and called him a Jew lover. I know this because I followed their posts.

To this person, getting murdered by a psychopath is just as natural a consequence as dying of an overdose from drugs you intentionally ingested.

I didn't know Charlie personally. But he did send me a kind message last year. "I love all people" is what he said. If that is any indication of who the man was, then this country has lost someone special today.

There’s likely a minor hormonal component to IF’s mechanism, particularly through subtle shifts in ghrelin, leptin, and insulin that support better hunger and fullness regulation. But no particular hormonal effect; the primary driver remains increased awareness of eating cues.

A recent meta concluded that hormonal changes in IF are “modest and not distinct” from those seen in continuous calorie restriction. The primary mechanism appears to be behavioral—the eating window ↑↑ mindfulness of hunger and fullness cues, which drives the calorie reduction.

Don't think about strategy when you haven't built anything yet!

When you're starting, it's much better to focus on a specific customer (even better if you're the customer!) and making them extremely happy— than to go through the motions playing startup while worrying about TAM

My 69 year old client lost 60 pounds in less than 6 months and thus massively improved his body fat %, waist to height ratio and overall health. 

We always kept exercise at (a little less than) 1 hour per week, and the general approach is “no fuss”. 

Go, James

I think it’s not a good idea to assume that, if you can squat, bench or deadlift a lot of weight, then you’re in good health. 

Why? Because fatter people can generally lift heavier. 

Much better to use pull-ups as an exercise proxy to assess overall health.

If you’re going to set any kind of resistance training targets, my advice is to use body weight exercises such as push-ups, pull-ups, and dips. 

The kind of exercises you perform best at when you have good body composition (low body fat % + decent muscle mass).

JD “I don’t give a shit” Vance says killing people he accuses of a crime is the “highest and best use of the military.”  

Did he ever read To Kill a Mockingbird?  

Did he ever wonder what might happen if the accused were immediately executed without trial or representation??

.@POTUS is right. 

We’re now firmly behind the curve and in the “too late” part of the cycle. Further, it’s not really clear The Fed has a plan beyond an initial cut. 

We need to move to a system that relies more heavily on real time data, published transparently.
